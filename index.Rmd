## Passenger Class

1. 1st class had the best survival rate proportionally
2. The crew had the worst survival rate proportionally (went down with the ship?)
3. 3rd class also had a poor survival rate

--- .class #id 

## Gender

1. There were about 3 times more men than women aboard
2. Women had a dramatically better survival rate than men
3. Was it because women and children got on the lifeboats first?

## Age

1. Only a little more than 100 children aboard
2. Children had a dramatically better survival rate than Adults
3. Likely some correlation with the higher survival rate of women
